Are Shortcuts Good or Evil? v1

Essential Mac Modifications 20.02.21v1

I don't know why but I've always believed that any shortcut or modification that could save you some time was a net positive. This belief has led me to discover hundreds of shortcuts and niche software.

Recently I saw a TechLead YouTube video that presented a different school of thought. TechLead explains that a top engineer should be able to take any hardware/software out of the box and immediately be effective.

Hearing this new school of thought rattled me a bit and I have since landed somewhere in-between the two beliefs. While I still believe that a few key programs can add a ton of value (Alfred, KM) there should be a high bar for adding new systems or rules to your personal flow. Why? For the love of the game. If I need to work on a loaner laptop or a team members setup, I know I will be slower but I want to at least recognize why I am slightly slower.

With this in mind I decided to document the modifications I was making on my new macbook. Steps below with notes in Red.

Installation Steps (imagine doing this in your spare time, I have a family):

1.  WiFi

2.  Sign in with Apple ID

3.  Sign in with Google Account

4.  REALIZATION: Most of my data / work is stored in accounts, passwords, files, etc. Even my browsing history was (obviously in retrospect) transferred over

5.  System Preferences

1.  "Trackpad"

1.  "Point & Click"

1.  Enable "Tap to select"

2.  Slide "Click" to "light" and "Tracking Speed" to "Fast"

3.  "Accessibility"

1.  "Pointer Control"

1.  Slide "Double-click speed" to "Fast" (this is the only one where I'm not quite sure of the impact)

2.  "Trackpad Options..."

1.  Slide "Scrolling speed" to "Fast"

2.  Select "Enable dragging" and choose "three finger drag"

4.  "Mouse Options..."

1.  Slide "Scrolling speed" to "Fast"

5.  "Apple ID"

1.  Select "iCloud Drive" (all Apple ID options should now be selected)

1.  This will also transfer over all Finder Preferences:

1.  Tags: Deselect any that are selected

2.  Sidebar: Deselect recent tags, select Adam's Macbook Pro

3.  Advanced: Select "Show all filename extensions"

7.  "Dock"

1.  Select "Automatically hide and show the Dock"

7.  Screen Shots

1.  Command + shift + 5 > Options > Save to "Other locations..." > Create "Mac Screenshots" folder in iCloud and select

9.  Trim dock

1.  Remove: Launchpad, Mail, FaceTime, Messages, Music, Podcasts, TV, Numbers, Keynote

11. Window Management

1.  Install Magnet and set the following shortcuts:

2.  NOTE: Do NOT indulge yourself in the Magnet vs. Spectacle debate.Â 

1.  After just killing too many brain cells on this I loosely prefer Magnet because 1. it feels a bit more polished and 2. Has a better logo. However, I strongly believe that this is not a debate worth having at all, choose one and move on. The entire open source vs. app store capitalists debate does not hinge on your actions here. I desperately hope my future self does not waste another 30 minutes angrily reading ProductHunt and App Store comments.

Non-essential modifications (this will have to wait for tomorrow)

-   Alfred, workflows and snippets sync via Dropbox

Conclusion: so much of the customization is handled by GOOG/AAPL that additional modifications can be consolidated among a few services.
